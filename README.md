Created and compiled using Visual C++ 2015 on Windows 10.

This program uses OpenGL and ray tracing to display planes, triangles and 
spheres with lighting, shadows and reflections.

Note:	Scenes may take some time to be rendered.
		On my computer scene 1 takes 25 seconds but scene 3 takes 2 minutes.

Keyboard controls:

1	Scene 1

2	Scene 2

3	Scene 3
